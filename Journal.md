## Weeks 1-2: GCP Resource Cleaner & Initial Stateless Infrastructure Steps

### PR permissions : 2025-05-29

## Key Rotation : 2025-06-30

## Key Rotation : 2025-07-07

- Talk with the mentor about the key rotation script, he suggested to control everything inside the script, including the key rotation schedule. This will be done in the next phase. Add logs to the key rotation script. Authentication for the key rotation script will be done through each service.

## Stale Cleaner : 2025-07-09

- Add new prefixes to the stale cleaner.
- Implement a cleaner for stale pubsub subscriptions that do not have a topic.

## GCP Access Terraform : 2025-07-25
